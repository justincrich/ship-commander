# Ship Commander 3 -- User Workflows (Revised Mental Model)
# End-to-end task flows spanning multiple screens and interactions
# Each workflow represents a complete user journey from goal to outcome
#
# REVISED MENTAL MODEL:
#   The Admiral manages a fleet. Workflows center on: building the fleet,
#   creating directives, planning missions, launching ships, monitoring
#   execution, and handling communications.
#
# Personas:
#   staff-commander  -- Senior developer, power user, full LCARS experience
#   junior-lieutenant -- Novice user, learning the system, needs guidance
#   fleet-admiral    -- Manager/architect, executive overview, minimal detail

personas:
  - id: staff-commander
    name: Staff Commander
    description: >
      Senior developer or tech lead comfortable with CLI tools. Uses Ship Commander
      daily to orchestrate complex features across multiple ships. Expects full
      LCARS aesthetic, real-time monitoring, keyboard-driven navigation, and deep
      drill-down capability. Manages multiple ships simultaneously.
    goals:
      - "Orchestrate complex features across multiple ships without losing visibility"
      - "Maintain control over agent output (inspect, halt, retry) per ship"
      - "Parallelize work across ships and within ships"
      - "Debug agent failures quickly when things go wrong"
      - "Ship faster through fleet-level automation while maintaining quality"

  - id: junior-lieutenant
    name: Junior Lieutenant
    description: >
      Junior to mid-level developer learning the system. Needs clear guidance,
      safe defaults, and progressive disclosure. Starts with a single ship
      and grows to managing a small fleet.
    goals:
      - "Commission first ship and launch a simple directive without confusion"
      - "Understand the ship/directive/crew/mission hierarchy"
      - "Get help when stuck (clear errors, contextual help)"
      - "Build confidence through successful missions"

    name: Fleet Admiral
    description: >
      Engineering manager or architect overseeing multiple projects. Wants
      fleet-wide metrics, batch operations, and minimal detail. Drills down
      only when something needs attention across any ship.
    goals:
      - "Track progress across all ships without micromanaging"
      - "Identify blockers quickly across the fleet"
      - "Batch-approve completed waves efficiently"
      - "Ensure quality via gate pass rates fleet-wide"
